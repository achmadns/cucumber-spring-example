# Behaviour Driven Development Practical Example with Cucumber and Spring

A little bit overkill example how to create a calculator object with Cucumber and Spring to showcase how to work with Spring beans in the Cucumber context.

See [calculator.feature](src/test/resources/us/gotcurio/achmadns/cucumber/calculator.feature) for the example and ctrl-click (in IDE) on the steps to navigate through the corresponding Java codes.

Notes: The example was made with IntelliJ IDEA with Cucumber plugins activated.
